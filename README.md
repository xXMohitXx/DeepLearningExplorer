# 🧠 Deep Learning Explorer

**Deep Learning Explorer** is an interactive educational website for visualizing and understanding core deep learning concepts. Explore neural networks, CNNs, LSTMs, backpropagation, and the mathematical foundations of deep learning—all with beautiful, interactive D3.js visualizations and clear explanations.

---

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Interactive Visualizations:** See how convolution, pooling, stride, and padding work in CNNs, and explore LSTM cells, backpropagation, and more.
- **Math Fundamentals:** Learn the linear algebra, calculus, and probability concepts that power deep learning.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with React, TypeScript, D3.js, and Material UI for a smooth, responsive experience.
- **Educational Focus:** Designed for students, educators, and anyone curious about how deep learning works under the hood.
